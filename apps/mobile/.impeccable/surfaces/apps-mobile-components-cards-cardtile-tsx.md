# Card tile — Tray

## Scope / mode
Operate — search + deck-builder catalog grids only.

## Direction
Tray: art on top, flush `bg-card-panel` tray with one-line name, single-row price + SKU (SKU never clips), and full-width soft Add (`h-9`). Owned uses matching − n +. Plain Pressable so printing picker keeps working. Dense on phone: prefer truncation of long price ranges over growing the tray.

## Memorable moment
Thumb hits a full-width Add under the print.

## Constraints
Do not change drawer / OwnershipStepper / motion / icon system. Preserve quick-add and foil picker.
