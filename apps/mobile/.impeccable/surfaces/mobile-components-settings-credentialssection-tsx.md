# Surface: Settings credentials

## Scope
Operate mode. Settings credentials panel — email identity, change email (OTP), change password (reveal). Primary: `apps/mobile/components/settings/CredentialsSection.tsx`. Related: `PasswordSection.tsx` (legacy wrapper), `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`.

## Audience / job
Signed-in collectors adjusting account credentials without leaving the instrument Settings surface.

## Task
Scan current email + verification state; expand only when changing email or password; confirm new email via OTP before it becomes active.

## Constraints
Inherit DESIGN.md terminal war room. No new visual world. Mail-configured only for email change + reset link. Match AuthSlabCorners / ash hairline vocabulary used by SharedCollection and EmailVerification.

## Direction
Unified Credentials panel (scan-first expands). Assumption after unanswered brief probe: recommended unified structure with inline OTP (product already uses emailOTP).

## Memorable moment
Identity strip at rest; opening Change email reveals a tight new-address → code → commit ladder on the same slab.
